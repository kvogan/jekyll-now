I am publishing a sort of schedule for tutorials planned for January to keep me on track. If any of the below is interesting to you, you may wish to bookmark this page and check back every so often, as I will I will update the  list with links as each post is published.

<h3> Posts and Tutorials Planned for January </h3>

- Quilt Math Reference for Traditionally Pieced Half-Square-Triangles (HSTs)
- Quilt Math Reference for Traditionally Pieced Flying Geese
- Quilt-As-You-Go Placemats
- Simple Lined Canvas Totes

I am also in the process of designing a foundation paper pieced pattern to be released at some point in the next few months, so there will be progress updates on that periodically. You can also expect posts on fabric dying and painting.
