featimage-alt: Piece Half Square Triangles the Traditional Way!
excerpt: The Half-Square-Triangle (HST) is a marvellously versatile block. Itâ€™s a key element in many traditional pattern designs.  In this post, I offer up a tutorial on traditional piecing HSTs. <b>Included is a printable reference table for HSTs ranging from Â¾ inch square to 20 inch square so that youâ€™ll never have to do the quilt math again</b>.

There are quite a few tutorials online with different ways to make HSTs. Modern quilters have found techniques and methods to piece multiple HSTs at once. These are great methods if you want to save time, but **if you only need a few HSTs**, the traditional method is the way to go. Personally, I find that traditional piecing is also the most **precise way to piece**. (I actually sew most of my HSTs the traditional way, regardless of how many I need to sew. I find chain piecing them together to be quite soothing.) Plus, if you piece traditionally, you **have greater control over where your bias edges end up** on your finished unit.

<h3>Making Half Square Triangles</h3>

To begin, you will need one square of each of the two fabrics that will make up your HST. To figure out the size of these squares, **add 7/8 inches to the finished side length** of your desired HST. For example, **if I am aiming for an HST of 2 in, I cut the square to 2 7/8 in**. If you want some wriggle room, add **1 inch**; you will need to trim down your units. If you, like me, can never remember the exact formula (*do I add to the finished or unfinished dimensions?*), and are tired of constantly googling it, [**I have created a downloadable, printable reference table for HSTs ranging from Â¾ inch square to 20 inch finished (increasing in increments of Â¼ in). Look up the desired dimensions of a finished (or unfinished!) HST and the chart gives the size of the initial square to cut. No math needed. Click here to open the chart.**]({{ site.baseurl }}/Traditionally Pieced Half Square Triangle Cutting Chart.pdf)

Using a rotary cutter and a ruler, **bisect the squares from corner to corner to create two triangles**.  Take one triangle of each colour, match them right sides together. Pin if needed. Sew along the hypotenuse of the triangle (the longest side). Be careful not to pull on the edges when sewing as you are sewing along the bias edge and the bias edge is stretchy. However, once you are finished sewing this seam, all bias edges will be enclosed in the block!

 Open the unit and press. Trim if necessary. You have made one HST unit!

There are many different block layouts you can make with HSTs! Here are some:

Have fun with your HSTs!
