Welcome to meandmy6friends.com! My name is Katrina.

I love quilts, poetry, hockey, cats, and musicals!

I've never blogged before and I'm weirdly nervous(?). I plan to post a bunch of tutorials and patterns in addition to the typical blog stuff.

You can read more about me [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/about)
